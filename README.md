# Introduction to Transformers and Hugging Face

This project introduces the concepts of Transformers, one of the most powerful models in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and demonstrates how to use them for real-world applications through Hugging Face's powerful platform. Hugging Face provides over 20,000 pre-trained models for a wide variety of NLP tasks, and this guide walks through key concepts, applications, and hands-on tutorials.

## Contents

1. **Introduction to NLP and Transformers**  
   - Understand the basics of Natural Language Processing and explore real-life applications.
   - Learn about the impact of recurrent neural networks in NLP and their limitations.

2. **Why Transformers?**  
   - Discover how Transformers address the drawbacks of recurrent networks through parallel computation and self-attention.
   - Components of Transformer models, including encoder, decoder, multi-head attention, and feed-forward networks.

3. **Transfer Learning in NLP**  
   - Learn about the importance of transfer learning for training complex deep learning models.
   - Examples of popular models like BERT and GPT-3.

4. **Introduction to Hugging Face**  
   - Overview of the Hugging Face platform, which offers a wide range of pre-trained models, datasets, and APIs.
   - Applications across text, speech, vision, and reinforcement learning.

5. **Using Hugging Face Transformers**  
   - Introduction to the `pipeline()` API for performing NLP tasks like text generation, translation, classification, and more.
   - Hands-on tutorials for each application:
      - **Language Translation**: Translating text with the MarianMT model.
      - **Zero-shot Classification**: Classifying text without pre-existing labels using the multilingual zero-shot classification model.
      - **Sentiment Analysis**: Using the distilled BERT model to analyze the sentiment of text.
      - **Question Answering**: Extracting information from text using question-answering models.
